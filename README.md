## About Project 

There are two steps to make this project:

  1) Clicking a background image.
  
  2) Select any RGB color (ie. your clothe color)
  
  Now everytime when i wear this clothe i became invisible 
  
  ##### Basically how I do this? 
  
  I remove all the pixels on the screen where we have the color that I choose and replace it with the image that I previously set.
